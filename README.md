# Tutorials / Projects in ML & DL

MNIST Networks -> fully connected, deep, CNN

TF Basics -> Variables, Placeholers, sessions, training etc.

Music classification -> obtain spectrograms of clips of music, train CNN on them

AAPL Stock Prediction -> Uses Quandl to fetch data and uses basic regression to predict time series

Fashion MNIST -> a simple CNN to classify Fashion MNIST dataset

XNOR Net (incomplete) -> Binarised input as well as weights, backprop requires comples tensorflow funtions

age prediction -> kinda big network to predict age

autoencoder -> simple, denoised autoencoder trained on MNIST

cam scanner -> Thresholding, Hough lines, transformation etc.

mnist similar -> uses autoencode with KNN to select images with similar strokes

transfer learning -> transfer learning on VGG 16
